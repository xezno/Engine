# Engine

This is a basic game engine created for personal practice and use; it uses the [entity-component-system (ECS) pattern](http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/11/11/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-2/) wherever possible.

## Building

### Prerequisites

#### Required

- .NET Core 3.1
- Visual Studio 2019
- Windows

#### Recommendations

- Windows 10
- A decent graphics card & processor

### Instructions

1. First, clone the repository recursively with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/xezno/engine`

2. Next, run `git submodule update` to ensure that all submodules are up to date.

3. Then, build OpenGL.Net:
   
   - Open the `Other/OpenGL.Net/OpenGL.Net_VC15.sln` file
   
   - Build the projects `OpenGL.Net.CoreUI_netcore3.1` and `OpenGL.Net.Math_netcore3.1`

4. Once complete, open Source/Ulaid.sln and build the solution.

## Code Conventions

Throughout this project, the standard [C# coding conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions) should be observed and used within any pull requests / any other direct contributions.

The following project-specific naming conventions are used:

- Classes ending in `Entity` derive from the `Entity<T>` base class, and - as the name suggests - are much similar to the entities found within a typical ECS project.

- Classes ending in `Component` derive from the `Component<T>` base class, and are much similar to a component found within a typical ECS project.

- Classes ending in `Manager` derive from the `Manager<T>` base class; unlike their name, they are similar to a system found within a typical ECS project - this name was chosen to prevent any confusion with the `System` namespace within .NET.Â 

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

Cross-platform compatibility is currently untested, and Windows 10 is currently the only verified platform; your mileage may vary when attempting to run the project on a non-Windows operating system. In the somewhat distant future, however, this should change.

## Support

Since Engine is a personal project that I am developing solely within my free time, I cannot guarantee or provide any maintenance or support right now. In the future, this might change - it all depends on the direction the project takes.

## Roadmap

As previously mentioned, this engine is a free-time project and I have no step-by-step roadmap. That being said, there are a few large goals that I want to achieve within this project:

- Physically based rendering for all objects within a scene
- Decent lighting
- Some form of multiplayer with a text-based chat system
- Anvil
